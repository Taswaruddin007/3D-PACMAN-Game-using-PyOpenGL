# 3D PACMAN Game Utilizing PyOpenGL

This project is part of the CSE423 course, where we explore various graphical techniques, including the Mid-point line drawing algorithm, the 8-way Symmetry line drawing algorithm, transformations, color models, shading, and lighting models. 

The project is a collaborative effort among three members: 
1. Mohd Tashwaruddin Safin 
2. Angshu Bisswash 
3. Fazle Tashfiq 

We have aimed to integrate all the concepts we have learned thus far into this project. The code for the project has been made available for review; however, we advise against copying directly from it for personal use to ensure originality.
